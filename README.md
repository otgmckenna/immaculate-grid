# Adequate Matrix - An Immaculate Grid Clone
 A built-from-scratch replica of Sports Reference's [Immaculate Grid](https://www.immaculategrid.com/) web game using Python and the [Lahman Baseball Database](http://seanlahman.com/). The interface for this game was made using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org) and [Pygame GUI](https://pygame-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

 The data was converted into a SQL database using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin4. Queries will be made using Python and [psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/). A file, sql.py, has been included that should automatically create the tables needed.

 > [!NOTE]
 > The Lahman Database included in this repo only has data up to the 2023 MLB season. Any stats from the 2024 or 2025 seasons are currently unaviable but will be added when the data is made available in the Lahman Database.
